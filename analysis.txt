Thoughts on NFL Players Association vs New York Sasha:
            Oh boy, it's the battle of the clueless! Lamar Jackson, representing the "NFL Players Association" - because apparently, they couldn't afford a real team name - is squaring off against Deshaun Watson and the illustrious "New York Sasha." I'm not sure what's more amusing: the fact that someone thought "Sasha" was a intimidating team name, or that these quarterbacks are probably wondering if they accidentally signed up for the wrong league. Either way, I'm sure this game will be a masterclass in how NOT to play football.
